frame->slots  DONE
* A pointer within the stack.
* Essentially, the base pointer of a frame.
* The next 'argCount' elements can be expected to be contiguous.
* If we can presume that green threads would only get context switched at loop
  or function boundaries, then the slots would naturally be contiguous, as they
  all would have been initially pushed together (into the A region), or else
  they would have been collected together (and exist contiguously in the B or
  C regions).
* The frame->slots assignment in vm.cpp:call() must ensure the slots are
  mutable. This will be guaranteed by not allowing any context switches
  except at loop or function boundaries.
* The behavior of OP_RETURN: when returning to outer frames we must make sure
  that the newly-current frame's slots will exist in the mutable A section
  (to allow their mutability).  If this isn't already true, the slots must be
  moved there and the tristack adjusted.

vm.stackTop  DONE
* Factored out into an independent "tristack" structure.




ObjUpvalue::value
   Can it be done via modification to a cb_offset_t?  Seems unlikely as structs
     will shift underneath it.
   Can it be modified to an index off of the stack instead?  This may make
     dereferencing sloppy and slow.

vm.frames -
  To be modified into a linked-list of frames, or a linked-list of arrays of
    frames.
